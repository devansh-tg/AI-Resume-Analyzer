## Architecture 🏗️

### Core Modules
- `enhanced_app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `advanced_nlp.py` - AI/NLP processing engine
- `enhanced_analyzer.py` - Resume analysis pipeline
- `mock_interview.py` - Interview simulation system
- `gamification.py` - Achievement and progress tracking

### Fallback Strategy
The system gracefully degrades when advanced dependencies aren't available:
- Falls back to basic NLP when transformers unavailable
- Uses SQLite when MySQL not configured
- Provides basic charts when Plotly not installed
- Continues working with core features only

3. **Skill Matching**: Find best candidates for specific roles
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: View hiring trends and insights

### For Privacy-Conscious Users

3. **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection
4. **Zero Data Retention**: No server-side storage

## API Access 🌐

Start the API server:
```bash
cd App
python resume_api.py
```

Example API call:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo_key_123" \
  -F "resume=@sample_resume.pdf" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/analyze/single
```

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues
1. **Dependencies Missing**: Run `./setup_enhanced.sh` for automatic installation
2. **Database Errors**: System automatically falls back to SQLite
3. **Performance Issues**: Reduce analysis complexity in settings
4. **Memory Issues**: Use client-side processing for large files

### Performance Tips
- Use client-side processing for sensitive documents
- Enable caching for repeated analyses
- Use API for bulk processing
- Adjust analysis depth based on needs
